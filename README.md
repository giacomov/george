This is a fun side project I made while on paternity leave (3 weeks).

It is a ROS2-based software that runs on a small bot powered by a NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It allows a user to control the bot through voice commands. The bot has a microphone to hear the commands, a screen to display the parsed command, as well as a camera that shows the point of view of the bot streaming it to your laptop.
